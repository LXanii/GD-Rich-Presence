# How to use

Using this is very easy
1. Go to: https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Sign into Discord (This is the official Discord site, we only need this for the user id.)
3. Click "New Application" at the top right
4. Name it preferably "Geometry Dash"
5. Once the bot is made, go to the "OAuth2" Tab
6. Click on "Copy" under the Client ID
7. Paste that Client ID in the ID portion of the Config File
(In between the 2 "", Ex: user id = "133321023")

These are 1 time steps, so once you do this you will not have to do this again.

If I can find an easier way to make this work I will, but for now this is what you have to do.
